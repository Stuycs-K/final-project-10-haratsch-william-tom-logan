 Work Log

## William Haratsch

### May 22nd

Completed Project Outline Draft.

### May 28th
Planned out the utilization of layered noise maps, and fractals as a noise map.

### May 29th
Planned out implementation of BPCS steganography in Processing.

### May 30th
Wrote code for the modifyImageBPCS() method. It iterates through the pixels, checking for complexity. If the complexity is below a certain threshhold, the data will be written into the pixel.

At home: completed a simpler implementation of the modifyImageBPCS() method. Will then complexify the implementation/add use cases.
