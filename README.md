## Overview
Project layout:
    - Two aspects
        - (1) Image Steganography using a noise map and BPCS 
    Option 1:
        - Easier and simpler to implement. More freedom. 
        - Use surrounding pixels to determine complexity of a pixel
        - if pixel is within complexity threshold (changing it wont change visibly) input data into pixel
        - Use random seed of perlin noise map to further encrypt the data

## Instructions
