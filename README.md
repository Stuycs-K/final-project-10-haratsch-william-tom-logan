## Overview
Project layout:\
    - Two aspects
        - (1) Image Steganography using a noise map for encrpytion and complexity tests to figure out where to store data\
        - Modify data using noise map to further encrypt the data \
        - Check bitplanes and create changes to bits based on calculated complexity\
        - If a pixel is in an area of sufficient complexity data is stored there
